""" Rules
    for words that begin with consonant sounds,the initial consonant
    or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word, and 'ay' is added,
    as in the following examples:
    'happy'->'appyhay'
    'duck' ->'uckday'
    'glove'->'oveglay'
    For words that begin with vowel sounds or silent letter, you just add
    'way' to the end.Examples are:
    'egg'->'eggway'
    'inbox'->'inboxway'
    'eight'->'eightway'
